# üõ†Ô∏è Simple Differential Drive Bot with Caster Wheel

This repository contains the implementation of a basic mobile robot modeled using **Xacro**, simulated in **Gazebo** and **RViz**, and controlled via **teleoperation**.

---

## üì¶ Features

- ‚úÖ Robot built with URDF/Xacro
- ‚úÖ Differential drive mechanism (two wheels + one caster wheel)
- ‚úÖ Simulated using **Gazebo** and visualized in **RViz**
- ‚úÖ Controllable using **teleop_twist_keyboard**

---

## üß± Robot Description

### üîó Links

- `base_link` - The reference coordinate frame for the robot.
- `chassis` - Main body of the robot.
- `left_wheel` - Left wheel for movement.
- `right_wheel` - Right wheel for movement.
- `caster_wheel` - A fixed, passive support wheel.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Joints

- `chassis_joint` - Fixed joint between `base_link` and `chassis`.
- `left_wheel_joint` - Continuous joint connecting `base_link` and `left_wheel`.
- `right_wheel_joint` - Continuous joint connecting `base_link` and `right_wheel`.
- `caster_wheel_joint` - Fixed joint attaching the caster to the chassis.

## üöÄ How to Launch

### 1. **Build the Workspace**

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select my_bot
source install/setup.bash
```

### 2. **Launch the Simulation in Gazebo**

```bash
ros2 launch my_bot sim.launch.py
```

This will:

* Launch Gazebo with your robot
* Start the Robot State Publisher
* Spawn the model in simulation

### 3. **View in RViz**

```bash
ros2 launch my_bot rsp.launch.py use_sim_time:=true
```

Or use:

```bash
rviz2
```

and load the config in `rviz/robot_config.rviz`.

### 4. **Control the Robot**

Install teleop package if you haven't:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-teleop-twist-keyboard
```

Then run:

```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```

## üì∑ Preview

*(Add screenshots or a short demo GIF here of the robot in RViz and Gazebo)*

---

## üìö Dependencies

* ROS 2 (Foxy/Humble/Iron etc.)
* `gazebo_ros`
* `xacro`
* `robot_state_publisher`
* `teleop_twist_keyboard`

---

## üìé Notes

* Ensure your Xacro file is valid:

  ```bash
  xacro robot.urdf.xacro > robot.urdf
  ```
* Make sure `robot_description` is correctly published via `robot_state_publisher`.
* For motion, ensure differential drive plugin is loaded in Gazebo.
